# Reduced gene templates for supervised analysis of scale-limited CRISPR-Cas9 fitness screens
![alt text](https://github.com/AleVin1995/Reduced_Templates/blob/main/web/Graphical_abstract.png)

## Description
Minimal Template Estimator (MinTEs) is a computational framework for assembling gene templates of reduced size allowing supervised analyses of data from scale-limited CRISPR-Cas9 screens, while having a limited, user-defined impact on the overall library size.

This module contains the snakemake pipeline to derived reduced gene templates (coming soon..) and the jupyter notebooks are provided to reproduce all the plots shown in "Reduced gene templates for supervised analysis of scale-limited CRISPR-Cas9 fitness screens".

## Setup
Clone code repository and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/AleVin1995/Reduced_Templates.git

cd Reduced_Templates

conda env create -f envs/MinTEs_env.ymml
```
